# Fruit Merge architecture and feature guide

## Scene-authoritative fruit setup

Every file under `Scenes/Fruits/Variants` owns its sprite scale, collision shape,
collision offset, and any fruit-specific visual alignment. `FruitData` owns the
chain metadata (tier, score, next tier, mass, preview fallbacks, and the UI-only
`guide_color` accent). Do not
replace a variant collision shape from code.

When adding a fruit:

1. Add its enum tier in `Scripts/Data/enums.gd`.
2. Create its `FruitData` resource under `Data/Fruits`.
3. Create its scene-owned variant under `Scenes/Fruits/Variants`.
4. Register both paths in `Autoloads/FruitDatabase.gd`.
5. Set an opaque, non-white `guide_color` matching the fruit artwork.
6. Run `Tests/run_all.gd`; the validator checks chain continuity, guide colors,
   and required nodes.

## Runtime responsibilities

- `GameManager`: run state, modes, combo scoring, discoveries, and statistics.
- `SaveManager`: versioned profile migration, transactional save, and backup restore.
- `EconomyManager`: validated currencies, ownership, equipment, and consumables.
- `SceneRouter`: the only normal scene navigation entry point.
- `HapticManager`: mobile feedback categories and accessibility strength.
- `DailyMissionManager`: daily progress and automatic rewards.
- `AchievementManager`: permanent achievement progress and automatic rewards.
- `FruitDatabase`: scene-authoritative fruit scene and preview cache.
- `GameplayJuice`: merge particles, bursts, shake, haptics, and tier rewards.
- `PowerupController`: input targeting and the six gameplay power-up behaviors.
- `FruitFactory`: creates fruit under the dedicated gameplay `FruitContainer`.

## Game modes

- Classic: standard danger-line endless play.
- Relaxed: danger-line game over is disabled.
- Time Attack: a two-minute scoring run.
- Daily Challenge: the spawn sequence is seeded from the date and the first
  completed run each day awards a bonus ticket.

The mode button below Play cycles through these modes.

## Fruit-colored landing guide

The spawner's moving dashed landing guide uses the current fruit tier's
`FruitData.guide_color`. A dark outer stroke, translucent colored glow, and light
colored core keep red, blue, purple, yellow, and green guides readable over both
the container art and the fruit pile. The color refreshes with the preview after
every drop; it does not tint or otherwise modify the fruit sprite.

All landing-guide presentation values are exported in the Spawner's `Drop guide`
Inspector category: fruit-color toggle, fallback/override color, dash and gap
lengths, scroll speed, three stroke widths, three opacities, darkening, and
lightening. The scene defaults use a thin 1.5 px core with 3 px glow and 4.5 px
shadow. Disable `guide_use_fruit_color` to use `guide_override_color` globally.

## Persistent shuffled music

`AudioManager` owns the complete four-track playlist for the lifetime of the app.
Bootstrap starts it once after restoring the saved volume. Scene and tab scripts
must not select or restart music, so navigation between Home, Shop, Achievements,
Daily Reward, and gameplay leaves the current track and playback position intact.
Headless validation skips audio playback while still loading and checking the
four-track registration, avoiding audio-server resources during forced test exit.

Imported WAV loop flags are disabled on private runtime copies. The manager plays
every track once in a shuffled four-track cycle, reshuffles after the cycle, and
prevents the last track of one cycle from immediately repeating as the first track
of the next. Two persistent players overlap for a sine-eased crossfade near each
track's end. `music_fade_in_duration`, `music_crossfade_duration`, and
`music_silent_db` are exported on the AudioManager autoload for tuning.

## Danger line and overflow

`Scenes/Core/main.tscn` exposes a `WorldOrigin` at `(360, 1280)`. It translates the
Camera2D and authored gameplay world together so the camera's 720×1280 rectangle
overlaps the fixed-screen HUD in the 2D editor without changing runtime composition.
Inside it, a scene-authored `ContainerRig` contains both `ContainerArt` and the
physical `BoxContainer/Box` instance. Moving that one rig keeps the artwork, walls,
floor, and danger line aligned; its shipped local Y offset is 50 pixels. The Box
instance remains expandable in Main and its collision shapes are edited in
`Scenes/Entities/Box/box.tscn`. The standalone HUD scene intentionally contains no
world visuals or physics. World-space clamps must use the Box's global center and
must not assume that gameplay is centered around global X zero.

The central peach Play button on the Home and Shop docks shares
`Scripts/UI/Components/floating_button_animator.gd`. It runs a subtle looping
rise/dip/settle sine tween with small scale and rotation accents, starts after
safe-area placement, and stays static when reduced motion is requested. Shop's
dock script uses the scene-authored `HomeButton`, `AchievementsButton`,
`PlayButton`, `ShopButton`, and `SettingsButton` node contracts; validation checks
that all five remain present.

The dashed line measures a sustained pile overflow, not a fruit passing through it.
`Box` records that each fruit has entered the container, reads the top and bottom
extents from that fruit's scene-owned collision shape, and starts its danger dwell
only while the fruit remains above the line and is sleeping or moving below the
configured settled-speed threshold. Frozen/grabbed, merging, fast-falling, and
outside-container fruit are ignored.

Classic mode shows the warning tint after `danger_warning_delay` (0.5 seconds in
the box scene) and ends the run only at `danger_settle_time` (2.4 seconds). Brief
bounces recover faster than danger accumulates, preventing warning flashes during
normal drops while still keeping pressure on a genuinely full container. Relaxed
mode clears the danger state and never shows the overflow warning.

## Responsive merge timing

`MergeService` keeps its post-await validity checks but uses a 0.075-second
convergence instead of a long anticipation pause. Source fruit shrink/fade over
0.10 seconds, and fruit created by `FruitFactory` use a 0.035-second chain-merge
lock. Normal dropped fruit retain a 0.10-second contact lock. This makes direct
merges and cascades feel immediate without allowing a fruit to merge twice during
the same physics contact.

## Portrait shop containment

The three-column shop grid uses compact 210 x 320 minimum cards with a card-local price
panel style. Card contents now fit their declared minimum height, titles have a
dedicated row, and the optional stacked power-up count sits over the icon. The
owned badge was removed; owned cosmetics reuse the action label for `SELECT` and
`ACTIVE`. Both cards and the catalog panel clip their children. Category repopulation frees
old cards immediately, preventing one-frame overlap. Header ad copy is ASCII-only
and sized for the 720-wide portrait canvas.

## Power-ups

The HUD and shop support Level Up, Shake Box, Remove Smallest, Grab 'Em, Hammer,
and Juice Bomb. Tunable feedback values live in each `ShopItemData` resource.
New power-ups need a shop resource, catalog entry, HUD entry, and controller
implementation. The debug validator ensures every required power-up is catalogued.
Shake Box uses one synchronized directional tween for its physical walls and
container art, plus an upward fruit impulse, delayed lateral kick, spin, camera
feedback, and two-stage haptics. Its strength and timing values remain data-driven.

## Cosmetics

Pets use their existing texture map. Skin equipment changes the in-game fruit and
container palette. The Sunny Garden background enables the supplied background art.
Equipment is stored as profile settings and applies on the next gameplay scene.

## Mobile UX

Interactive top and bottom controls account for `DisplayServer.get_display_safe_area()`.
Safe-area offsets are applied only on Android and iOS. Desktop safe-area values
describe the monitor/work area rather than a notch inside the game window, so using
them on Windows can push portrait controls outside the embedded debug viewport.
Haptics are grouped by tap, drop, merge, big merge, power-up, danger, game over,
and reward. Settings expose continuous 0–100% Music and Sound Effects sliders, a
vibration toggle, and language selection. The unused Theme and Game Feel selectors
were removed; the settings scene has no placeholder controls that claim to apply
an unavailable visual or effects preset.

Save version 7 removes retired `theme`, `feedback_level`, and audio-restore keys.
It restores standard haptic/shake/motion values so a previously saved Minimal/Off
preset cannot remain active without a corresponding control. Music/SFX volumes,
language, and the independent vibration toggle are preserved.

Hindi and Spanish `.po` resources translate the core interface. Newly added copy
should use stable English source strings so Godot's automatic translation lookup
can find it.

## Desktop debugging

The PC debug window is resizable even though the production target is portrait
mobile. In debug builds, focus the running game and press `F11` to toggle between
windowed and fullscreen modes. When using Godot's embedded game view, black space
around the 9:16 viewport is editor workspace rather than missing game content; use
the game-view menu to run it in a floating window when testing fullscreen behavior.

After changing window, stretch, or safe-area settings, stop and restart the running
project so Godot recreates the debug window with the updated configuration.

## Validation

Run from a terminal with Godot 4.7:

```powershell
godot --headless --rendering-method gl_compatibility --path . --script res://Tests/run_all.gd
```

The content validator also runs automatically in debug builds. It checks the fruit
chain, scene-owned fruit nodes, shop IDs and definitions, required power-ups, core
scene paths, settings-slider contract, removed settings options, and shop-card
containment.

GDScript warnings are treated as validation defects. Avoid local names that shadow
base `Node2D`/`CanvasItem` properties, cast enum-to-integer calculations explicitly,
and make intentional division types explicit so the editor Debugger remains clean.

## External mobile integrations

`AdManager` is a safe game-side bridge, but release ads and no-ads purchases still
require a platform node named `/root/MobileMonetization` supplied by Google Mobile
Ads and Google Play Billing plugins. It must implement the methods documented in
`Autoloads/AdManager.gd` and call completion methods only after verified SDK callbacks.

The Privacy Policy button also needs the final public policy URL before store release.

## Documentation rule

Every behavior, architecture, setup, content, platform, or validation change must
update this guide (and the README when it affects first-time setup or common usage)
in the same change set. A feature is not considered complete until its documentation
matches the implementation.
